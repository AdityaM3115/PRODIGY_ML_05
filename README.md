1] app.py : This file helps establish connection with the database and necessary functions with the web application
2] food_dataset.py : This code defines a custom PyTorch dataset class called FoodDataset. This class is designed to handle a dataset consisting of images of food items and their associated calorie (kcal) values.
3] test_food_dataset : This code snippet demonstrates how to use the FoodDataset class you defined earlier to create and work with a dataset of food images and their calorie (kcal) values. 
4] train_model.py : The file is very important as it helps train image recognition model using an existing module called TorchVision.
5] remove_invalid_files.py : This file combs out the image dataset to remove files which are not supported or invalid.
6] index.html : The code provides the structure of the web page where users will upload their images.
